REQUIRE EPIC FIGHT AND WINGS REBORN MOD

A simple mod that fixes Wings Reborn's flying animation not playing when using Epic Fight's custom player model by replacing it with a custom animation

Should be installed on both client and server side

Note: Other player's flying animation may look a bit weird as I couldn't find a way to fix it, other than that you can see your own animation just fine
